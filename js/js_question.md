### Different Data Types in JavaScript
**Question:** What are the different data types available in JavaScript? Can you give an example of each?
**Explanation:** JavaScript has several data types: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `object`, and `symbol`.

### `let`, `var`, `const`
**Question:** What's the difference between `let`, `var`, and `const`? When should you use each?
**Explanation:** `var` is function-scoped, while `let` and `const` are block-scoped. `const` is used for variables that shouldn't be reassigned.

### Why We Must Not Use `var`
**Question:** Why is using `var` considered bad practice in modern JavaScript development?
**Explanation:** `var` can lead to unexpected behavior due to its function scope and hoisting. `let` and `const` provide block scope, reducing bugs.

### Why Using Global Variables is Bad
**Question:** Why should global variables be avoided in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** Global variables can lead to conflicts and unintended side effects across different parts of the code.

### Truthy and Falsy Values
**Question:** What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript? Can you provide examples?
**Explanation:** Truthy values evaluate to `true` in a boolean context, while falsy values evaluate to `false`. Examples of falsy values include `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, and `false`.

### Function Hoisting
**Question:** What is function hoisting in JavaScript? How does it differ between function declarations and function expressions?
**Explanation:** Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be called before they are defined in the code. Function expressions are not hoisted.

### What Happens When a Function Does Not Have a Return Statement
**Question:** What is the return value of a function that does not explicitly return anything?
**Explanation:** If a function doesn't have a return statement, it returns `undefined`.

### Different Ways of Declaring a Function
**Question:** What are the different ways to declare a function in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** Functions can be declared using function declarations, function expressions, arrow functions, and methods within objects.

### Pass by Reference and Pass by Value
**Question:** What is the difference between pass by reference and pass by value in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** Primitive data types are passed by value, meaning a copy is passed. Objects and arrays are passed by reference, meaning the actual reference is passed.

### Different Types of For Loops
**Question:** What are the different types of for loops in JavaScript, and when should each be used?
**Explanation:** JavaScript has several types of loops: traditional `for`, `for..in` (for objects), `for..of` (for iterable objects like arrays), and `forEach` (array method).

### Searching MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)
**Question:** How can you effectively search for JavaScript documentation on MDN?
**Explanation:** Use keywords and the MDN search function or include "MDN" in your search queries on search engines.

### Popular Array Utility Methods
**Question:** What are some popular array utility methods in JavaScript, and what do they do?
**Explanation:** Methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, `some`, `every`, `find`, and `includes` are commonly used to manipulate arrays.

### Popular String Utility Methods
**Question:** What are some popular string utility methods in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** Methods like `split`, `replace`, `toUpperCase`, `toLowerCase`, `trim`, `includes`, `startsWith`, and `endsWith`.

### Popular Object Utility Methods
**Question:** What are some popular object utility methods in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** Methods like `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, `Object.entries`, and `Object.assign`.

### When to Use forEach vs. Array Utility Methods
**Question:** When should you use `forEach` versus methods like `map`, `filter`, or `reduce`?
**Explanation:** Use `forEach` for iteration without returning a new array, and `map`, `filter`, `reduce` for creating new arrays with transformations.

### Immutable and Mutable Methods
**Question:** What is the difference between immutable and mutable methods in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** Immutable methods return a new array or object without modifying the original, while mutable methods change the original.

### Error Handling (try...catch)
**Question:** How does the `try...catch` block work in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** The `try` block contains code that might throw an error, and the `catch` block handles the error if it occurs.

### Throwing Errors
**Question:** How do you throw errors in JavaScript, and what is the difference between `throw new Error("message")` and `throw "message"`?
**Explanation:** `throw new Error("message")` creates an error object, providing a stack trace, while `throw "message"` throws a string.

### Reading Error Messages and Tracing Issues
**Question:** Why is it important to read error messages and trace issues from the stack trace?
**Explanation:** Understanding error messages and stack traces helps identify and fix bugs more efficiently.

### Importance of `catch` Block
**Question:** Why is the `catch` block important in error handling?
**Explanation:** The `catch` block allows you to handle errors gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.

### Spread Operator
**Question:** How does the spread operator (`...`) work in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** The spread operator allows an iterable to be expanded in places where multiple arguments or elements are expected.

### Template Literals
**Question:** What are template literals, and how do you use them?
**Explanation:** Template literals use backticks and allow for string interpolation and multi-line strings.

### Default Parameters
**Question:** What are default parameters in JavaScript functions?
**Explanation:** Default parameters allow you to specify default values for function parameters if no argument is provided.

### Destructuring
**Question:** What is destructuring in JavaScript, and how is it used?
**Explanation:** Destructuring allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

### Closures
**Question:** What is a closure in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.

### Difference Between Arrow Functions and Regular Functions
**Question:** What are the main differences between arrow functions and regular functions?
**Explanation:** Arrow functions have a shorter syntax, no `this` binding, no `arguments` object, and can't be used as constructors.

### Difference Between `===` and `==`
**Question:** What is the difference between `===` and `==` in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** `===` checks for strict equality (both value and type), while `==` performs type coercion before checking for equality.

### Why Using `value === undefined` is Better Than `!value`
**Question:** Why is `value === undefined` preferred over `!value`?
**Explanation:** `!value` can give false positives for other falsy values like `0` or `""`, while `value === undefined` specifically checks for `undefined`.

### Array Utility Methods Chaining
**Question:** How can you chain array utility methods in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** Methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` can be chained together to perform multiple operations on an array in a concise manner.

### Difference Between `null` and `undefined`
**Question:** What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, while `null` is an assignment value that represents no value.

### Importing and Exporting Modules Using `require` and `module.exports`
**Question:** How do you import and export modules in Node.js using `require` and `module.exports`?
**Explanation:** Use `module.exports` to export functions or objects from a module, and `require` to import them in another file.

### Different Methods of `console`
**Question:** What are the different methods available on the `console` object in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** Methods like `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`, `console.info`, and `console.debug` are used for different types of logging.

### Best Practices (Indentation, Variable Naming, etc.)
**Question:** What are some best practices in JavaScript coding?
**Explanation:** Use consistent indentation, meaningful variable names, and avoid global variables. Follow code conventions and style guides.

### Passing Functions to Other Functions
**Question:** How can you pass functions as arguments to other functions in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions and invoked within those functions, enabling higher-order functions.

### Differences Between Named Functions and Anonymous Functions
**Question:** What is the difference between named functions and anonymous functions in JavaScript?
**Explanation:** Named functions have a name identifier, while anonymous functions do not. Named functions are useful for recursion and debugging.

### Variable Number of Arguments Passed to Functions
**Question:** How can a JavaScript function accept a variable number of arguments?
**Explanation:** Use the `arguments` object or rest parameters (`...args`) to handle a variable number of arguments in a function.
