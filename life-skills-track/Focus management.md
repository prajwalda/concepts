### Question 1: What is Deep Work?

**Deep Work** is a concept developed by Cal Newport, which he defines as professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve skills, and are hard to replicate. It contrasts with "shallow work," which consists of non-cognitively demanding tasks that are often performed while distracted and can be easily replicated.
