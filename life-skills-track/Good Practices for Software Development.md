## Question 1
**Which point(s) were new to you?**

1. **Using sandbox environments like CodePen or CodeSandbox to share the entire setup**: This method of sharing code and issues in a fully interactive environment was new to me.
2. **Joining meetings 5-10 minutes early to get some time with your team members**: This specific practice to build rapport and improve communication with team members was new to me.
3. **Using tools like TimeLimit or Freedom to block social media sites and apps during work hours**: The specific tools mentioned for blocking distractions were new to me.
4. **Tracking your time using apps like Boosted to improve productivity**: The recommendation to use a specific time-tracking app to boost productivity was a new point.

## Question 2
**Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

I need to improve on over-communication. Often, I assume that everyone is aware of changes or issues I'm facing without explicitly informing them. To make progress in this area, I plan to:

1. **Use group chats/channels more frequently:** I'll make it a habit to update relevant channels whenever there's a change or issue, ensuring everyone stays informed.
2. **Set reminders for updates:** I'll set reminders to regularly update my team on the progress of tasks, especially when unexpected delays occur.
3. **Practice prompt responses:** I will work on responding promptly to messages and calls, even if it means just acknowledging and promising a detailed reply later.
4. **Document changes clearly:** Whenever requirements change, I'll ensure to document these changes and share them with the team, along with the new deadlines if applicable.
