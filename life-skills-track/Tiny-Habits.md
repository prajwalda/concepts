# Tiny Habits

## Question 1
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

One of the most interesting ideas presented in the video is BJ Fogg's concept of the "tiny habit." He explains that by starting with very small, easy-to-do actions, people can create lasting changes in their behavior. For example, he suggests starting with something as simple as doing two push-ups after brushing your teeth. This idea is compelling because it shifts the focus from trying to make big, daunting changes all at once to making small, incremental changes that are more sustainable and achievable. This approach can help overcome the common problem of feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of big changes and can lead to significant improvements over time.

## Question 2
**How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

To make new habits easier using B = MAP:

- **Increase Motivation (M):** Identify your why and break down large goals into smaller ones.
- **Optimize Ability (A):** Make the behavior easy to do by simplifying the process.
- **Design Effective Prompts (P):** Create reminders that are hard to ignore.

By balancing and optimizing M, A, and P, you can make forming new habits easier and more sustainable.

## Question 3
**Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**

Celebrating or "shining" after each successful completion of a habit is crucial because it:

- Provides positive reinforcement
- Boosts motivation
- Helps form habits
- Creates an emotional connection to the behavior
- Shapes a positive self-image

To make celebrating a habit, try:

- Tracking progress with checkmarks or stickers
- Treating yourself to something enjoyable
- Sharing success with a friend or accountability partner
- Reflecting on progress and writing it down
- Creating a celebration ritual

Remember, celebrating your successes is key to building lasting habits and staying motivated!

## Question 4
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting story or idea for me from this video is the concept of the "aggregation of marginal gains" presented by James Clear. The idea that small, incremental improvements (1% better every day) can lead to significant gains over time is fascinating. The example of Dave Brailsford, the coach of the British cycling team, who implemented this philosophy to achieve remarkable success, is inspiring.

The idea that small habits and choices can compound over time to transform us is a powerful message. It's not about making drastic changes or seeking radical improvements, but rather about making small, consistent efforts that add up to significant progress.

## Question 5
**What is the book's perspective about identity?**

According to the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, identity change is the North Star of habit change. The book suggests that most people work from outcome to identity, rather than identity to outcome. This means that people often focus on achieving a specific outcome or result, rather than focusing on changing their underlying identity or beliefs.

The book argues that the ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of our identity. When we solve problems in terms of outcomes and results, we only solve them temporarily. But to solve problems in the longer term, at the systems level, we need to change our identity.

## Question 6
**What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**

The book "Atomic Habits" suggests making a habit easier to do by reducing the number of decisions, creating implementation intentions, and designing the environment to support the habit. It also emphasizes reducing friction, or obstacles, that make it harder to perform the habit. By making habits easier, we are more likely to stick to them and build lasting habits.

The book also emphasizes the importance of "friction" in habit formation. Friction refers to the obstacles and barriers that stand in the way of performing a habit. By reducing friction, we can make habits feel easier and more automatic.

## Question 7
**What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**

According to the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, making a habit harder to do is a crucial step in breaking bad habits. The book suggests that one of the key laws of behavior change is to "make it unattractive" or "make it difficult." This means increasing the friction and effort required to perform a bad habit, making it less likely that we will continue to do it.

Overall, the book suggests that making bad habits harder to do is a key step in breaking them and replacing them with better habits. By increasing friction and effort, we can make bad habits less appealing and less automatic, and increase our chances of success.

## Question 8
**Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious, the habit more attractive or easy, and the response satisfying?**

**Habit:** Reading more books.

- **Make the cue obvious:** Place a book next to my favorite coffee mug, so every time I grab a cup of coffee, I see the book and am reminded to read.
- **Make the habit more attractive:** Choose books that are interesting and engaging, so I look forward to reading them.
- **Make the habit easy:** Keep a book with me at all times, so I can read during breaks or while waiting in line.
- **Make the response satisfying:** Track my progress by keeping a reading log or using a habit-tracking app, so I can see how far I've come.

## Question 9
**Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive or hard, and the response unsatisfying?**

**Habit:** Using social media less.

- **Make the cue invisible:** Remove social media apps from my phone's home screen, so they're not the first thing I see when I unlock my phone.
- **Make the process unattractive:** Use a website blocker or app that tracks and limits my social media usage, making me more aware of how much time I'm wasting.
- **Make the process hard:** Set my phone to grayscale mode, making the visuals less appealing and reducing the temptation to scroll.
- **Make the response unsatisfying:** Set a reminder or notification that pops up after 10 minutes of social media usage, saying "You've wasted 10 minutes of your life. Is this really what you want to be doing?"
